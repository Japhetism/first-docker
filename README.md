This project was created with html

# Build the Docker Image for the HTML Server

Run the following command: 
### `docker build -t html-server-image:v1 .`
You can confirm that this has worked by running the command: 
### `docker images`

# Run the Docker Container
Run the following command to run the HTML container server:

### `docker run -d -p 80:80 html-server-image:v1`
